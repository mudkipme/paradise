# [WIP] Paradise

A web application for Pokémon fan communities to capture, collect and trade Pokémon.

*This project is a work in progress.*

The origin of this project dates back to a plugin for a PHP online forum system in 2005, which later used on the legacy *52Poké Forums*. It iterated several major versions around 2010 and in 2013 it became a complete rewrite in Node.js and Backbone Marionette in the `legacy` branch, *a.k.a V6*.

The `develop` branch is another complete rewrite started in 2018 after [52Poké Forums](https://52poke.net) moved to a new system, it is designed to be a standalone GraphQL web application and work with OAuth2 providers such as GitHub and MediaWiki (a NodeBB OAuth2 server implementation is also planned).
